#### Header
- **Title**: Version 1.1.1.8 - Frontend Authentication Components Implementation
- **Date**: 2026-01-21

#### What We Did Section
- **Environment Setup**: Configured React frontend environment with Vite build tool, TypeScript for type safety, and Tailwind CSS for styling.
- **Documentation Updates**: Marked "Create frontend components for user registration and login forms" as completed in Version 1.md.
- **Files Created/Modified**: Created ui/src/pages/Login.tsx, ui/src/pages/Register.tsx, ui/.env, ui/src/vite-env.d.ts; modified ui/src/App.tsx and ui/src/main.tsx.

#### Detailed Explanations
- **New Files Created**:
  - **Login.tsx**: This is a webpage component that shows a login form. It has boxes for email and password, and a button to sign in. When you click sign in, it sends your info to the backend server to check if it's correct. If login works, it saves a special code (token) in your browser so you stay logged in. For beginners: Imagine this like the door to enter the website - you type your email and password, and if they're right, the door opens and you can go inside the site.
  - **Register.tsx**: This is a signup webpage. It has forms for email, password, and confirm password. There's also colorful chip buttons to select your roles (like Member in blue, Youth in green, Elder in purple, Treasurer in orange, Pastor in red) - you can click to add or remove multiple roles. Plus a special search box where you type a pastor or admin's name to choose who will approve your account. When you submit, it creates your account with your selected roles but you can't login yet until the approver says yes. For beginners: Think of this as applying for a library card with different membership types shown as colorful stickers. You fill out a form, click the colorful stickers for what types of books you want (roles), pick a librarian to check you, and then wait for approval before you can borrow books.
  - **auth.py**: This is the backend authentication code. It has endpoints for user registration, login, and searching approvers. The register endpoint now accepts approver ID and intended roles, verifies the approver exists, and creates the user account. The approvers search endpoint finds eligible pastors/admins who can approve new users based on the intended role. For beginners: Think of this as the librarian's computer system. It handles signing up new members, checking login credentials, and helping find the right person to approve new memberships.
  - **vite-env.d.ts**: This is a technical file that tells TypeScript (our code checker) about special settings from the environment. It defines what config values we can use, like the API address. For beginners: It's like a dictionary that explains what words (settings) the computer understands.
  - **.env**: A settings file that stores the address of our backend server (like http://localhost:8000). This tells the frontend where to send requests. For beginners: It's like knowing the phone number of the restaurant - the frontend needs to know where to call the backend.
- **Modified Files**:
  - **App.tsx**: Added two new webpage paths: /login and /register. Now when you visit the site, you can go to these pages. For beginners: This is like adding new rooms to your house - now there are login and register rooms you can visit.
  - **main.tsx**: Set up the tool that sends requests to the backend. It reads the server address from the .env file and uses it for all API calls. For beginners: This is like setting up your phone to always call the right number when you need to talk to the backend.
- **Technical Details**: The components use React (a tool for building websites), TypeScript (helps catch mistakes), and Tailwind CSS (makes things look nice). They send data to the backend using axios (like sending a letter). Login saves a token in browser storage so you stay logged in. Registration includes a search that finds pastors/admins to approve new users.
- **Visual Diagrams**: None required for this implementation phase.

#### Usage Instructions
- **Setup Steps**: Go to the ui folder and run `npm run dev` to start the website locally.
- **Configuration**: Make sure .env has the correct VITE_API_BASE_URL pointing to your backend server.
- **Testing**: Open your browser to the site, click to /login or /register pages, and try filling out the forms (backend needs to be running for full testing).

#### Status/Next Steps
- **Current Status**: Frontend login and registration forms are created and ready to use with the backend.
- **Next Batch**: Implement JWT token handling for staying logged in across page refreshes.

## How did we Test if the Code works:
- [x] Created Login component and verified it renders a form with email/password fields and submit button
- [x] Created Register component and verified it renders signup form with approver search
- [x] Added routes to App.tsx and confirmed /login and /register URLs work
- [x] Set up axios base URL in main.tsx to connect to backend API
- [x] Created .env file with API configuration
- [x] Added TypeScript definitions for environment variables
- [x] Verified components compile without errors in development mode
