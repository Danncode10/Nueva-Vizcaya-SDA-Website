#### Header
- **Title**: Version 1.1.1.5 - Database Setup and Server Testing
- **Date**: 2026-01-20

#### What We Did Section
- **Environment Setup**: Configured local PostgreSQL database connection, updated database URL to use current user credentials.
- **Documentation Updates**: Added database setup task to Version 1.md roadmap and marked as completed.
- **Files Created/Modified**:
  - Modified backend/backend/app/core/config.py - Updated DATABASE_URL to use lesterdannlopez user for local PostgreSQL connection
  - Modified docs/Versions/Version 1.md - Added database setup task and marked as completed

#### Detailed Explanations
- **Modified Files**:
  - **app/core/config.py**: Changed the default database URL from using 'postgres' user to 'lesterdannlopez' to match the local PostgreSQL setup on macOS with Homebrew. This allows the FastAPI application to connect to the PostgreSQL database without authentication issues.
  - **Version 1.md**: Added a new task "[x] Setup database in DBeaver for Local in my macbook" to the Version 1.1.1 roadmap, documenting the database setup step that was completed. This ensures the project roadmap reflects all implementation steps.
- **Technical Details**: PostgreSQL database 'nv_sda_db' was created using DBeaver GUI tool. The connection uses localhost:5432 with the current macOS user credentials. FastAPI automatically creates database tables on startup using SQLAlchemy's create_all() method.
- **Visual Diagrams**: None required for this setup phase.

#### Usage Instructions
- **Setup Steps**: Use DBeaver to connect to PostgreSQL (localhost:5432, user: lesterdannlopez), create nv_sda_db database. Run FastAPI server with `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`.
- **Configuration**: Database URL in config.py points to local PostgreSQL instance.
- **Testing**: Access http://localhost:8000/docs for API documentation, database tables created automatically on first run.

#### Status/Next Steps
- **Current Status**: Database setup complete, FastAPI server runs without errors, tables created successfully.
- **Next Batch**: Test API endpoints, seed initial data, and implement frontend components.

## How did we Test if the Code works:
- [x] Connected to PostgreSQL via DBeaver and created nv_sda_db database
- [x] Updated database configuration to use correct user credentials
- [x] Ran FastAPI server successfully without database connection errors
- [x] Verified server accessible at localhost:8000 with API docs available
- [x] Confirmed database tables created automatically on startup
